# Restaurant Database System

We have created a restaurant database system. End users are the primary endpoint that will interact with the system. Users can perform various functional tasks such as: Registering themselves, registering their addresses,  reserving a table, writing a review, search for restaurants based on zip code, city or ratings, view given ratings for a particular restaurant,view his/her profile and can find discount coupons for a particular restaurant.
